        <h1>About Pathways</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Pathways Group of Schools is a chain of International K12 and Pre-Primary schools located in the Delhi-Gurugram-Noida region. The curriculum includes the Primary Years, Middle Years and Diploma Programme of the International Baccalaureate Organisation (IBO) of Geneva.

            Pathways World School Aravali was the first school to be launched under the Pathways umbrella in the year 2003. The institution was the first-day cum residential School in North India to get affiliated with the IB curriculum at that time.

            Today, the chain consists of five campuses – three International K12 Schools and two pre-primary schools. The other two K12 campuses – Pathways School Gurgaon and Pathways School Noida were launched in the year 2010. In the year 2012, the group entered the pre-primary segment with the brand name: Pathways Early Years.

            While preserving the best in traditional Indian and International education and culture, Pathways has opted for a student-centered system with ample opportunities for project work and discovery learning, guided by a well-qualified international teaching faculty with generous access to quality in service training both in India and abroad. In order to ensure that every student’s talents are developed to the full, the schools apply the Multiple Intelligences approach, developed by Dr. Howard Gardner from Harvard University.

            National and international experts developed the concept and plans for the school. They decided to name the school "Pathways" to represent Howard Gardner's multiple pathways to learning.

            Currently, Pathways is the only IB Continuum school chain in India.</p>

        <h1>School Director- Ms. Sonya Gandhi Mehta</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <span></span>

        <img id="director_pic" src="Sonya%20Gnadhi.png" style="height: 450px; width: 400px;">
        <p style="font-size: 20;">Ms. Sonya Ghandy Mehta, is a Graduate in Psychology and Education and has a Post Graduate Degree in Education from the University of San Diego, USA. She completed her Schooling from The Lawrence School, Sanawar, India.

            Ms. Mehta believes that she was born to be a Teacher. She joined teaching at the age of 21 and her 30 years of teaching and administrative experience has spanned over Special Education, setting-up Vocational Training Courses and Mainstream Education in ISC, IB and IGCSE Curriculums. Her professional career started in Jamshedpur as a teacher to Young Adults with Special Needs in 1991.

            Her strong belief about education is that it cannot be limited to the classroom and textbooks. In our ever changing world, it is crucial for education to constantly reinvent itself. What was relevant even 5 years ago might not be so today.

            Each child is a unique individual who needs a secure, caring, and stimulating environment in which to grow and mature emotionally, intellectually, physically, and socially. Her desire as an educator is to prepare students for life in an environment that is safe, supports risk-taking, and invites a sharing of ideas.

            There are three aspects in education that she believes are essential:
            1) Relevancy and Application - education must address the problems of today. Bringing real life issues into the classroom to make learning more applicable.
            2) Law of Expectation - the more you expect from a child, the more they will rise to meet the challenge.
            3) Promoting respect - this encompasses respect not only for people around us, but also for the environment and inanimate objects.</p>
